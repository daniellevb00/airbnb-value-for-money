# Assessing AirBnB's value-for-money

__Which cities in Europe have the best quality-price ratio ('value for money') in terms of Airbnb listings?__

## Motivation

We think this question is valuable to research as those who have limited financial means (such as students like us) would like to have the best quality accommodations for the lowest price that fits their budget. With the results of our analysis, we can form recommendations for this group regarding which European cities to visit, thereby better meeting the needs of this customer base and faciliating a more efficient search for listings when on the Airbnb site. 

## Data

AirBnB data used available at [Inside AirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).
