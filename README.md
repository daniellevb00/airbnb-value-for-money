# Assessing AirBnB's value-for-money

__Which cities in Europe have the best quality-price ratio ('value for money') in terms of Airbnb listings?__

## Motivation

By diving into this research question, recommendations can be formed on which European city to visit when being on a budget. These recommendations are of particular importance to those who have limited financial means, such as students. The results of our analysis can be utilised for the facilitation of this consumer base in terms of a more efficient search for listings when on the Airbnb site. Thus, the value of our projects lies in helping the individuals, who might not be able to book a holiday without this knowledge, to search for suitable accomodations and enjoy a holiday.
